# 🎲 Dice Roller Game

A simple **multiplayer dice game** built with Python where players take turns rolling a die to accumulate points. The first player to reach **60 points** wins the game!

## 📌 Features
- Supports **2 to 6 players**.
- Players take turns rolling a **6-sided die**.
- Rolling a **1** ends the player's turn and resets their score for that round.
- The first player to reach **60 points** wins the game.

## 🚀 How to Play
1. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python Project1.py

2. Enter the number of players (between 2 and 6).
3. Each player takes turns rolling the dice.
4. If a player rolls a 1, they lose their turn and their score for that round resets.
5. If a player rolls any other number, it is added to their current round score.
6. The player can choose to roll again (y) or end their turn.
7. The first player to reach 60 points wins the game.
